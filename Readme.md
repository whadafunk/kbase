## My knowledge base

![Cover Photo](./cover_photo.jpg)


I will update this repo with knowledge snippets whenever I find some tidbit that
made me loose more time than I needed, or is something not very intuitive.

I can add links and quotes from articles describing the workarround or I can
write myself a couple of lines about the workarround.
My intention is to have here all the information I need to solve a particular problem.

Also, I will try to keep topics separated in folders, as the repo will grow.
